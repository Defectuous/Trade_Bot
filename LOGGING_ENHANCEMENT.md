# Enhanced Hourly Logging System Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented an enhanced hourly logging rotation system for the trading bot that provides clean, organized log management.

## New Logging Behavior

### Previous System
- Logs were created with immediate timestamp: `TradeBot.MMDDYY.HH.log`
- Each run created a new timestamped file
- No consistent "current" log file

### New System
- **Initial logging**: Always starts with `TradeBot.log` (current active log)
- **Hourly rotation**: At the top of each hour (:00), current log is renamed to `TradeBot.MMDDYY.HH.log`
- **Fresh start**: New `TradeBot.log` is created for the new hour
- **Continuous operation**: Process repeats every hour automatically

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **`trade_bot.py`**: Enhanced `setup_file_logging()` function
   - Added `make_current_handler()` for TradeBot.log creation
   - Added `rename_current_log()` for timestamped archiving
   - Updated rotation logic to handle file renaming before creating new log

2. **`.env` and `.env.example`**: Updated logging documentation
   - Enhanced LOG_TO_FILE description with rotation behavior
   - Added examples of rotation timestamps

3. **`README.md`**: Updated logging configuration section
   - Documented new rotation behavior
   - Added monitoring examples

### Test Files Created
- **`test_simple_logging.py`**: Demonstrates basic rotation functionality
- **`test_bot_logging.py`**: Tests integration with actual bot
- **`demo_log_rotation.py`**: Complete demonstration of hourly rotation cycle

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Simple monitoring**: Always check `TradeBot.log` for current activity
- **Historical analysis**: Archived logs organized by hour (TradeBot.MMDDYY.HH.log)
- **Easy debugging**: Find specific issues by hour timestamp
- **Clean separation**: Each hour gets its own complete log file

### For Operations
- **Automatic management**: No manual log rotation required
- **Predictable filenames**: Current activity always in TradeBot.log
- **Systematic archiving**: Historical logs follow consistent naming pattern
- **Resource management**: Prevents single large log files

## Usage Examples

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# View current activity
tail -f log/TradeBot.log

# View historical logs
ls -la log/TradeBot.*.log

# Search for trading activity
grep -E 'BUY|SELL|GPT decision' log/TradeBot*.log

# Monitor specific hour
cat log/TradeBot.100225.14.log  # October 2, 2025 at 2:00 PM
```

### Log Rotation Timeline
```
09:59:59 - Writing to: TradeBot.log
10:00:00 - Rotation occurs:
         - TradeBot.log -> TradeBot.100225.09.log
         - New TradeBot.log created
10:00:01 - Writing to: new TradeBot.log
```

## Configuration

Enable in `.env`:
```bash
LOG_TO_FILE=true
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

The system automatically:
- Creates log directory if needed
- Handles file permissions
- Manages rotation timing
- Recovers from rotation failures

## Testing Results

All tests demonstrate successful implementation:
- ✅ Initial logging to TradeBot.log
- ✅ Proper file rotation to timestamped format
- ✅ New TradeBot.log creation after rotation
- ✅ Content preservation during rotation
- ✅ Integration with actual trading bot
- ✅ Error handling and recovery

## Backward Compatibility

The system maintains full backward compatibility:
- Existing log monitoring tools continue to work
- Log format and content unchanged
- All environment variables preserved
- Graceful fallback if rotation fails
